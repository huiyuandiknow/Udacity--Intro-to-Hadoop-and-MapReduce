Final Project: 

For the final project, we are writing 4 mappers & 4 reducers for each of the 4 sub tasks: 
1. Student Times: Find for each student what is the hour during which the student has posted the most posts 
2. post and answer length: Outputs the length of the post and the average answer length for each post 
3. top tags: output top 10 tags in questions
4. study groups: Outputs the student IDs of the participants of each post

Data is stored in the Data folder.
Codes are stored in the Code/Final Projects folder. 
Outputs are stored in the Output folder.
